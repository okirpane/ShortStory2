As he waited, he could hear the winds howling and rushing and rustling the grass. Children were running around in the small rickety playground near the house. Their cheers and jeers piercing through the otherwise boring neighborhood. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence knocked on the door again, slowly getting impatient. He had a tight schedule to keep, and many people to meet. He really didn&rsquo;t have all day. He knocked on the door again. Maybe his assignment was asleep or in the bathroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He pulled out a glistening bronze key from his pocket and inserted it into the door&rsquo;s lock. He twisted it around once, then turned the knob and pushed the door and swung it open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he briskly walked into the small, but warm living quarters he noticed a very old lady staring at him from a soft, heavily used green sofa. The woman was thin. Her woolen clothing was pastel pink, just like the exterior of the house, and her spectacles were so big they made her look like an owl. She had headphones on with music blaring out of them and a cup of tea in her hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They both stared at each other in silence for about a minute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo; The old lady screamed with equal parts disgruntledness and surprise. She set her cup of tea down on the small wooden table in front of her and adjusted her spectacles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m from the Central Bureau of Expiry. I&rsquo;m here to conduct the cessation process as mandated by the bureau and the State. I knocked a few time but no one -&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The money&rsquo;s under the floorboard.&rdquo; She took her headphones off and motioned to the creaky wooden floor beneath the table. &ldquo;You can take it, but it&rsquo;s only a few tenners.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to rob you. I&rsquo;m from the CBE, I&rsquo;m here to conduct the-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want money?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Cause if you do, Miss Chopra&rsquo;s place is next door, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get more from them. They&rsquo;re swimming in cash. Go there and leave me alone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence sighed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any money. I&rsquo;m a government agent. I&rsquo;m here to kill you.&rdquo; Laurence handed her his badge and documents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lady&rsquo;s eyes widened and her body went stiff. She took another sip of her tea to compose herself then said &ldquo;Okay. Take a seat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Laurence said uneasily. Those who were calm when he brought up their mortality were always slightly unhinged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He took a seat on the wooden chair opposite to the women and made himself moderately comfortable. The wallpaper had a hypnotic checkered pattern on it that made his eyes hurt and the TV on his left had a thin film of dust covering it. The whole room looked unkempt. The faint smell of bread and curried stew wafted through the whole damp wooden upholstery of the rickety house </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I need to confirm a few things before we start.&rdquo; Laurence opened his dinky briefcase and pulled out the women&rsquo;s profile, a voice recorder and a camera. He quickly took a picture of the woman, then started the voice recorder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;State your name and age for the record.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Linda Rebello. I&rsquo;m one hundred and forty seven years old.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Date of Birth?&rdquo; Laurence asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;January 23rd, 2005.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you aware that your monetary income is now at a value below one hundred dollars a month?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am one hundred and forty seven years old. Do you expect me to be toiling away in the rice fields?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence looked at her pointedly. &ldquo;Are you also aware that your savings account is empty, and your pension fund has run out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda sighed and rolled her eyes. &ldquo;I am painfully aware that my life is basically a puddle of mud right now. Get to the point.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence replied. &ldquo;As you know this means that in the eyes of the state you are now a dead asset. I have been sent to terminate you.&rdquo; Laurence paused. &ldquo;Please state for the record that you understand this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;I understand this.&rdquo; Linda said in a strained tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence tried to brighten the mood by adding a little cheer to his voice. &ldquo;Perfect. Let us begin!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, What happens now?&rdquo; Linda said as she contorted her face and subconsciously rubbed the right side of her neck. She felt a slight lump in the area her Birth chip was implanted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a fragment of plastic and metal sitting right under her skin tracking almost every aspect of her life. The chip was also supposed to terminate her when the time came. It was to Shut down her immortal body when she became a useless member of society. &ldquo;How do you activate the chip?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to use this device. We call it &lsquo;The Remote&rsquo;.&rdquo; Laurence took out a slim matte black cylinder with a complex looking circuit on its circular face and a needle on the other end.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay&hellip; &rdquo; Linda asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It activates your Birth chip! I will fill the container with a sample of your blood. That will verify that you are indeed who you say you are. Then I will press this sensor to your Birth chip and activate it. Then voila, you die, and I go to the next home and do this all over again.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence&rsquo;s grimaced at the thought of going through this all over again, but quickly quashed it. He tried to bring back his phony smile but his grimace remained and slowly turned into a sad sulk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Can&rsquo;t keep up your government mandated cheer?&rdquo; Linda asked wryly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one dying here. Why the hell are you sad?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Laurence said as he pierced Linda&rsquo;s arm to draw blood. &ldquo;I kill people for a living. I don&rsquo;t have a family, I&rsquo;m not allowed too. I have no friends, no colleagues, no life outside this soul crushing job.&rdquo; Laurence chuckled. &ldquo;The only perk of this job is that I get to live forever.&rdquo; Laurence wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be venting to his assignments He was supposed to keep verbal interaction to a minimum. But, he didn&rsquo;t care. She was going to die in a bit anyways.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;And, who wants to live forever?&rdquo; Linda added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Certainly not me.&rdquo; Laurence grinned slightly as he placed the remote on the table. He removed the needle and discarded it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all such colossal self-pitying knobs.&rdquo; Linda stated. Laurence blinked and raised his eyebrow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just quit.&rdquo; Linda said pointedly. &ldquo;Everyone will stop hating you. You will probably stop hating you&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But, somebody has to do this. Otherwise people like you will live forever. Our death rate will flaten, and the earth will become a barren wasteland devoid of anything.&rdquo; Laurence paused. &ldquo;At least that&rsquo;s what they say.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all dicks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence shrugged, then picked up his device. The remote had confirmed Linda&rsquo;s identity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you need some more time? I can wait, but only for so long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda bit back a snarky response. She stared at the black cylinder and tried to imagine what it would feel like when it activated her chip. Would it hurt? Would it be sudden or would it be slow? Would everything go dark or would her whole life flash before her, as her organs started to fail?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine to have trepidations.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Linda wanted to bury her face in her lap and weep. But, she stopped herself by forcing a rigid expression on her face. She tried to hide her sudden angst, but was very unsuccessful.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My grandson was going to visit for the first time, in forever. I was going to fix everything with him, with my son, with everyone. I just&hellip; &ldquo; Linda wiped a tear that broke free from the barrier she was constructing around her heart to keep her sadness within. &ldquo;I never thought I would be scared of death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda always thought she had lived a life free of fear and regret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She loved her husband and her son as much as she could. She loved her life when she used to wake up to a sunny day with her family. She loved cooking breakfast then going to the local school to mold young minds into the voices of the future. She loved drinking wine with her friends and gossiping till the sun set. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But her love left her and filled her with regret and sorrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She tried to put on a brave face and convince herself that she had lived the life she wanted to live. She wanted to be brave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t scare me.&rdquo; Linda told Laurence bitterly.&rdquo;You don&rsquo;t scare me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda took some deep breaths and locked eyes with Laurence. She needed some time to process her mortality. She needed to calm down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really have time-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go eat.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">---------</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda stood up and went to the kitchen and walked back out carrying a metal pot full of fragrant stew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda set it down on the wooden center table and gestured to Laurence. &ldquo;Come, help me get the cutlery out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Laurence was confused. He didn&rsquo;t really wanted to go but found himself strangely reluctant to disobey Linda. He wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to his other assignments, and that stew did smell </span><span class="c7">really </span><span class="c0">good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So, he got up and collected shiny cutlery from Linda&rsquo;s kitchen. He set them neatly on the table and started serving them both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Make sure you get some vegetables and </span><span class="c7">kofta </span><span class="c0">balls. Those are the best bits.&rdquo; Linda told him as she placed some sliced bread in his plate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a lot of stew.&rdquo;Laurence remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. I made it for my grandson. He loves stew.&rdquo; Linda stated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They both started eating in silence. Sounds of slurping and cutlery clinking were the only sounds heard for at least half an hour. Laurence noticed pictures of Linda with her husband and son. Apart from those pictures and a small framed painting that looked like it was made by a child, the room was devoid of things. THe emptiness somehow made the awkwardness more awkward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re scared of death too?&rdquo; Linda asked, breaking the silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; Laurence replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You clearly hate your job.&rdquo; Linda said. &ldquo;You said the only perk it has is escaping death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence paused to think. He lifted his bowl and drank the remaining stew from it and let out a satisfied sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe?&rdquo; Laurence paused the voice recorder he had cleared from the table. &ldquo;They told us we would be heroes. That we were doing a favour to humanity by killing. That we were releasing people from their miserable lives. But, we&rsquo;re just cleaning up their mess. They got excited about the prospect of living forever and just fucked up everyone&rsquo;s genome and tasked us with culling the herd.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, they convinced you guys to commit mass murder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Essentially.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quit because&hellip; &rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I&hellip; don&rsquo;t want to die.&rdquo; Laurence replied. &ldquo;Everyone fears death in some capacity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, they have you whipped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They have me whipped.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence and Linda finished their meal. Laurence offered to help clean the dishes as a way to make something up to her, in some small way. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to die in a bit. I don&rsquo;t think I mind a few dirty dishes in the sink before I go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence had to chuckle at his lame attempt at repayment. He was taking everything away from her, and he tried to make it all good by washing dishes?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You ready to go?&rdquo; Laurence asked. He set up the voice recorder on the table and held the activation remote in his hand. Linda saat upright on the sofa beside him and looked straight ahead with a steely look on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; Linda replied. &ldquo;Does it hurt?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; Laurence replied and readied himself. He hated this part of the job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it okay to die filled with regrets? Without the people you love around you? Seems a little sad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the good thing about death. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about any of that stuff. Everything just disappears.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Linda took a deep breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, do it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence pressed the device against Linda&rsquo;s neck. The Birth chip started to glow and illuminate her veins with a stark blue glow. Linda&rsquo;s body tensed a bit then slumped back. Her eyes stared vacantly as her back rested against the wall. She still had a determined look on her face. She was brave in her last moments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Laurence closed her eyes and collected his things. He stopped the voice recording packed his briefcase and straightened his suit. The disposal crew would be here in a few hours to collect the body. They were gonna be annoyed at the lack of bodies he turned over today, but they would get over it eventually. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stepped out of the house and closed the pastel green door behind him. He felt the wind rushing through his hair. The sun was bright and bathed the earth in its glow but failed to warm him as he shivered and walked to the next house.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
